Contains projects from CS3358 Data Structures and Algorithms course.

Project 1: User defined data type implemented to manipulate sets of numbers in a static array. 

Project 2: Makes Project 1 dynamic.

Project 3: Implements classes to handle the dynamic array.

Project 4: Uses templates to handle two different sets of data.

Project 5 Part 1: Unrelated to previous projects, implements linked list.

Project 5 Part 2: Implements a linked list of linked lists, with bread and depth first traversal.
